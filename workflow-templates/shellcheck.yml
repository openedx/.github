        # By default, the upstream action will use a reasonable, stable shellcheck version,
        # which will be updated over time as new stable ShellCheck versions come out.
        # If you want your repositoriy's build to be totally deterministic, though, then
        # override with a specific version pin here, and manage updates ShellCheck yourself.

        # OPTIONAL:
        # Command-line options to pass to ShellCheck.

        #   shellcheck <shellcheck-options> <input-files>
