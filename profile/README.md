# Welcome to the Open edX project.

We're glad you're here!
This GitHub organization holds the code defining the Open edX platform,
including its services, libraries, frontends, tools, and more.
If you're trying to learn more, check out...

* the homepage: [openedx.org](https://openedx.org),
* the discussion forums: [discuss.openedx.org](https://discuss.openedx.org/),
* the main LMS and CMS application repository: [edx-platform](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform),
* the community-supported installation method (also a development tool!): [tutor](https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/).

Although Open edX software is built by many developers across different organizations,
the GitHub organization itself is administered by [Axim Collaborative](https://axim.org).
If, as an Open edX contributor,
you need a GitHub setting changed or lack access that you believe you should have,
please [file a ticket with the Axim engineering team](https://github.com/openedx/axim-engineering/issues/new/choose).
