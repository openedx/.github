        This announces a pre-approved breaking change. These include planned upgrade tasks, removal of unreachable code, and subtasks of other approved DEPR tickets. Consult the DEPR Working Group if unsure.
        
        The standard DEPR process is described in [OEP-21](https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0021-proc-deprecation.html). This ticket is using the new ["Fast Track" Process]((https://github.com/openedx/.github/issues/175)), which means it will skip the Request-For-Comments (RFC) stages and move right to "Transition Unblocked."
      
        Please leave [DEPR] in the title of your ticket!
